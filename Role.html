    <div class ="paragraph">
        <p>In our project, there are 2 main roles including Hardware Engineer and Software Developer. There are only 2 core roles in our project due to 2 reasons. The first reason is that all the other tasks such as planning, testing, and writing reports are finished by all members of the team. We aspire to work together and enhance the teamâ€™s solidarity. In addition, working together can help us learn from each other and acquire more knowledge as well as experience.  Imagine that if each person just works with their tasks and sticks with their role until the end of the project, it would be extremely boring and there would be no motivation to work.  The second reason is that in certain situations, we need to change the role to other team members due to personal reasons or technical skills. For that reason, we are inclined to create a flexible environment for every member to work and study.</p>
        <p>+ Hardware Engineer is in charge of the hardware part of the project. As a hardware engineer, we need to select and collect components such as Raspberry Pi, sensors and other physical parts. Furthermore, hardware engineers have to assemble and configure the Raspberry Pi and sensors as well as guaranteeing the efficiency of the power supply system.</p>
        <p>+ Software Engineers are responsible for writing the code that reads sensor data from Raspberry Pi, implements data logging and storage solutions. In addition, software engineers also  need to develop the user interface by using visulialized tools to illustrate data for users.</p>
