    <!-- 3 Project Description -->
    <h4 class= "section">3.Project Description</h4>
    <!-- 3.1 Overview -->
    <h5 class = "sub-section">3.1.Overview</h5>
    <div class = "paragraph">
        <p class = "bold-text">Topic:</p>
        <p>The aim of our project is to create an automated plant watering system using Raspberry Pi and soil moisture sensors. This device focuses on plant care by ensuring plants receive the right amount of water at the right time, reducing the risk of over or under watering. The system consists of a soil moisture sensor placed in the plant’s soil. The Raspberry Pi will monitor soil moisture level and make decisions based on moisture thresholds. When the soil moisture drops, the arduino Raspberry Pi will automatically activate a water pump to deliver a precise amount of water to the plant. Ideally, the project will also include a user interface, accessible through a web application or mobile app, allowing the user to set moisture threshold, monitor plant health remotely, and receive alerts or notifications when intervention is required.  
        </p>
        <p>We hope that this system can improve plant health, and reduce manual plant care efforts. Users will benefit from a smart, automated solution that helps maintain healthy plants by providing water precisely when needed. Moreover, the project can be improved to support multiple plants, making it a scalable and user-friendly solution for both indoor and outdoor gardening. 
        </p>
        <p class = "bold-text">Motivation:</p>
        <p>This project is intended to solve the current problem in indoor gardening, as people usually forget to water their plants. The system will automate the process of watering plants, and keep track of the plant’s overall health. The project combines technology with a practical, real-world application that can address everyday challenges. It fits into current IT trends by embracing automation, sustainability, IoT connectivity, data-driven, and decision-making making it an interesting system for tech enthusiasts and plant lovers. This project will help us develop a variety of skills for our future career including technical skills, problem-solving abilities, project management competency, and a commitment to innovation and sustainability, etc. These skills are highly valued by potential employers, especially in IT and technology industries. 
        </p>
        <p class = "bold-text">Landscape:</p>
        <p>There are several similar systems and products that are available in the market, and it’s important to understand competition and compare differences with our own systems. The most common products are commercial automated plant watering systems. These systems are typically well designed and are easy to set up, however they can be relatively expensive. There are also IoT-based plant care devices which monitor plant health factors, including soil moisture, temperature, and light levels. These devices send data to mobile apps for remote monitoring but do not include any automated watering capabilities. Although there are alot of existing product and DIY solutions for automated plant watering systems, our project difference lies in its customization, scalability, cost effectiveness, and being an open-source project. We believe that we have an edge, and will be a valuable option for plant enthusiasts, and tech-savvy.

    <!-- 3.2 Aims -->
    <h5 class = "sub-section">3.2.Aims</h5>
    <div class = "paragraph">
        <p>As the requirements for assignment 2 of this course we have come up with an idea of making a machine that is based on the raspberry pi to automate watering and storing water based on the moisture in the soil and predicted weather throughout the years from weather predictions website as a source of data. This piece of machinery is aimed to help farmers to adapt to the rapidly changing climate due to global warming.
        </p>
        <p>The most important part of this project can be divided into two parts, the hardware, and the database. For the hardware part, we want to create a machine that is not expensive to acquire and not hard to maintain. While keeping it at an acceptable size but still sturdy enough to handle the hardship of weather. For the database our main difficulty comes in the form of accurate data and rapid data comparison to adapt to the weather changes and if possible, have the machine automatically act based on the given information.
        </p>
        <p>We expected our project outcomes would be a fully automated machine that can act on its own based on multiple reliable sources of information, while still allowing the owner to make manual adjustment if they deem the information unreliable or incorrect. We then will use the manual adjustment data as another source of information to compare with future data to make the most efficient predictions for the future.

    <!-- 3.3 Plans and Progress -->
    <h5 class = "sub-section">3.3.Plans and Progress</h5>
    <div class = "paragraph">
        <p>Inconsistent and frequently insufficient watering techniques?The Raspberry Pi Tree Watering Sensor project is the solution to this problem. The goal of this project was to monitor soil moisture levels and intelligently automate tree watering, assuring the tree doesn’t die out.</p>      
        <p>Project Development: The project's journey began with a thorough investigation of the hardware and software elements required for a reliable system. We selected the Raspberry Pi after carefully weighing our available microcontroller options. This device is recognized for its adaptability and open community support. It was crucial to choose soil moisture sensors that could deliver accurate readings in a range of soil types and environmental situations. The following integration of components would be the water pump and reservoir system.
        </p>
        <p>The physical infrastructure construction faced early difficulties. Careful fine-tuning was required to calibrate the soil moisture sensors to ensure accuracy across a range of soil profiles and climatic conditions. The system's installation of a fail-safe mechanism to prevent overwatering, a flaw sometimes ignored in automated irrigation systems, was a crucial component. </p>
        <p>The project's software component was equally complex. To communicate with the sensors, gather data, and plan precise watering decisions, we started working on a Python-based software. In order to get the best watering results, the algorithm evolved to incorporate moisture thresholds, real-time data processing, and the capacity to react to changing climatic conditions. . </p>
        <p>Future Projects: The following critical steps are included in our project roadmap and are necessary to fully utilize the Raspberry Pi Tree Watering Sensor: 
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li class = "scope-list">User Interface Development: Users will be able to customize irrigation settings, monitor soil moisture levels remotely, and get instant alerts thanks to this interface. Additionally, it will allow for the management of several trees.</li>
            <li class = "scope-list">Integration of Environmental Sensors: We are continually working on enhancing sensor capabilities by integrating more environmental sensors in order to give users an understanding of plant health. Users are able to evaluate not only the soil conditions but also the larger environmental context in which trees thrive thanks to the possibility that these sensors include temperature and humidity sensors.</li>
            <li>Documentation and Knowledge Transfer: Thorough documentation continues to be a high emphasis as the project moves forward. We are dedicated to producing thorough and user-friendly documentation that includes software code, hardware schematics, and precise assembly instructions. Our objective is to create a community of users and developers who can work together to advance and better the project. </li>

    <!--3.4 Roles-->
    <h5 class = "sub-section">3.4.Roles</h5>
    <div class ="paragraph">
        <p>In our project, there are 2 main roles including Hardware Engineer and Software Developer. There are only 2 core roles in our project due to 2 reasons. The first reason is that all the other tasks such as planning, testing, and writing reports are finished by all members of the team. We aspire to work together and enhance the team’s solidarity. In addition, working together can help us learn from each other and acquire more knowledge as well as experience.  Imagine that if each person just works with their tasks and sticks with their role until the end of the project, it would be extremely boring and there would be no motivation to work.  The second reason is that in certain situations, we need to change the role to other team members due to personal reasons or technical skills. For that reason, we are inclined to create a flexible environment for every member to work and study.</p>
        <p>+ Hardware Engineer is in charge of the hardware part of the project. As a hardware engineer, we need to select and collect components such as Raspberry Pi, sensors and other physical parts. Furthermore, hardware engineers have to assemble and configure the Raspberry Pi and sensors as well as guaranteeing the efficiency of the power supply system.</p>
        <p>+ Software Engineers are responsible for writing the code that reads sensor data from Raspberry Pi, implements data logging and storage solutions. In addition, software engineers also  need to develop the user interface by using visulialized tools to illustrate data for users.</p>

    <div class = "paragraph">
        <p>From week 1-2, we are going to plan and research about our project meticulously. We will divide our tasks in these 2 two weeks into small steps. Initially, we aspire to define our project objectives. Then, we will identify certain specific requirements such as soil type, tree type, temperature and water quanlity. After determining the goals and requirements, we aim to research several appropriate sensors such as temperature sensor, soil moisture and humidity sensor. The next step is to create a detailed plan to build the project and calculate a budget for purchasing components and materials. Finally, we have to plan a weekly schedule for communication between team members.</p>
        <p>From week 3-4, we intend to finish component procurement and set up these items. In week 3, we are going to order essential items such as Raspberry PI, sensors, power supply, tubing and so on. After purchasing these components, we will verify whether they meet our demands as well as check if these components are compatible with others. In week 4, we plan to spend time on researching and setting up Raspberry Pi with a suitable operating system. Finally, we will construct network settings and establish SSH or VNC remote access for the project.</p>
        <p>From week 5-6, we prepare for assembling sensors and confront with data. Firstly, we will install essential libraries for sensors. Then, we will utilize Python to write code to read data from sensors. After this step, we can combine sensor data with the Raspberry Pi and apply data logging to record sensor readings. Finally, we will create a local database to store this data.</p>
        <p>From week 7-8, our objective is to make a watering system prototype. First of all, we will choose an appropriate water pump so as to design a prototype watering system. From prepared sensor readings, we will write code to control and supervise our watering system prototype. In week 8, our team will spend on verifying and testing our prototype with a small-scale setup. After testing, we will modify watering parameters based on sensor data.</p>
        <p>From week 9-10, we will build a power supply system which provides energy for our watering system. In week 9, our ambition is to build a solar power system to generate energy by acquiring heat from the sunsight. This step will consume a range of time because we want to guarantee that our system can work for a long-term period. After building the power supply system, we will observe and verify our system to ensure our system can work efficiently. Furthermore, our team also plans to build a backup energy supply such as batteries in case our main power generator encounters issues.</p>
        <p>From week 11-12, we will cope with building user interface and data visualization. In the first week, our team will create a friendly user interface to help our customers can control and interact with the system easily. We also aim to provide users with data monitoring so that users can easily see fluctuations in soil moisture, humidity and temperature. To do this, we need to develop code and utilize visualization tools to display sensor data graphically in a clear way. After building the user interface, in week 12, we intend to create alerting systems which will send notifications via email and SMS for the clients.</p>
        <p>From week 13-14, we aim to spend these 2 weeks for verifying and final testing. Our team will conduct certain testing for all functions included in our project such as power system, user interface and so on. We will also troubleshoot components and codes to ensure that there are not any bugs or issues. We are inclined to test our system in a variety of different conditions to guarantee that our product runs smoothly, even in hazardous conditions.</p>
        <p>From week 15-16, this is 2 final weeks and we are going to write a report as well as prepare for a demonstration of our system. Firstly, we will divide each section for each member to write and set a deadline for this. After finishing the report, we will check it together and then we will gather to make slides for the presentation. In the last days of the project, we plan to organize a day to practice for the presentation.</p>

    <!-- 3.9 Risk -->
    <h5 class = "sub-section">3.9.Risks</h5>
    <div class = "paragraph">
        <p class = "bold-text">Software Hazard</p>
        <p>Our project heavily-relies on programming works to interface sensors to a central processing unit. Thus, the entire project itself is prone to hazards that may occur from software, in particular IDE malfunctions. This can range from the programming environment freezing up during development to having corrupted files upon compiling and testing of the project. Problems stated above can range from saving the project files frequently to prevent loss of work due to freezing to debugging and re-compiling corrupted files within the project folder.</p>
        <p class = "bold-text">Hardware risk</p>
        <p>The project involves using sensors to detect environmental conditions for other functions to work properly. This introduces potential hardware hazards that would all cause a dysfunction of the project system as a whole. Such hazards include manufacturing problems that resulted in faulty sensors, interfacing problems when trying to program the sensors. Furthermore, since the project is designed to be implemented in an outdoor environment, hardware is exposed and vulnerable to environmental hazards such as harsh weather conditions, wild animals that may damage the system. To best prevent the hazards above, the sensor systems and processing unit should be checked thoroughly for any manufacturing failures during the programming phase of the project. The system should also be placed in protective casing that were tested for most common extreme weather conditions in Vietnam such as heavy raining or heat waves while being sturdy enough to withstand mild impact from wild animals.</p>

    <!-- 3.10 Group Processes and Communication-->
    <h5 class = "sub-section">3.10.Group Processes and Communication</h5>
    <p class = "paragraph">Our group communicates mainly through our Facebook Messenger group, where we have added all members of the group, chat and calls/meetings. The official meetings are held once a week where every member is required to be present to be up-to-speed about the project’s processes and current progression; with in-between text chat for further information exchange between meetings. Face-to-face meeting is encouraged after classes on campus but is not the main method for our group meetings as some members sometimes cannot attend classes. In the situation where a group member does not respond to communications, we would try to reach out to them via @mentions or emails for a few days before reporting the case back to the lecturer for consulting on further actions. Luckily, we have not encountered such a situation.</p>

    <!-- 5 Group Reflection -->
    <h4 class = "section">5.Group Reflection</h4>
    <div class = "paragraph">
        <p><span class = "bold-text">Lam:</span> This project went well because as a group we have come up with creative ideas for modern gardening. This helps us not only learn about group work but also technical skills like web development, programming, etc. Although we don’t have time to meet up in person, working online was a breeze as it is effective, and convenient. I hope that everyone had a good time working together on this project</p>
        <p><span class = "bold-text">Tri:</span> During working with this project, I acquire a variety of new skills and learn many knowledge from other team members. For instance, I learned how to create a Gantt chart while working with the timeframe part. In addition, thanks to other team members, I have the opportunity to know more about Raspberry Pi and its function. I also learned about certain skills in HTML while working with others. In my point of view, our project is viable because it can solve issues about watering trees automatically and save a great deal of time and effort for people. However, I believe that there are still certain parts that we can improve in the future. For example, we can utilize CSS to help our website become more beautiful. Briefly, I learn a range of new skills from this project and I will work harder to enhance my IT skills.</p>
        <p><span class = "bold-text">Anh:</span> The group demonstrated a proficient level of skill in coding, leading to the completion of the assignment. This proficiency not only ensured the accuracy of our work but also allowed us to tackle the task efficiently. However there are some areas that could be improved like the meeting frequency. Given the semester's ending soon, increasing the frequency of our meetings would have been beneficial. More meetings would have ensured everyone was aligned with the project's requirements and goals. One surprising revelation was the simplicity of the coding content. Initially expecting to build a front-end website about our group project, it turned out that our task was primarily involved in creating a report document with HTML. This unexpected simplicity surprised me. Furthermore, our group composition, with members from different majors, provided a valuable learning experience. Discovering that not all members were IT majors made me realize the importance of leveraging different skill sets and perspectives</p>
        <p><span class = "bold-text">Viet:</span> I'm taking this course for the second time since the first time I took it, I didn't do well. I was in my first semester and still getting used to the new scheduling and study habits. It caused me to choose poorly quite a bit in the first semester. I tried to be more involved with my group during my second semester to keep everyone on track and to share any knowledge I had with them so they would know what to expect from the course and its tasks. This semester, my group is really capable. They completed their work on time and to a good standard, and they participated actively in conversation about the task, which substantially accelerated the development of the assignment. I wish that my future course groups would be like this group.</p>
        <p><span class = "bold-text">Khoi:</span> In general, the group gets along well and everyone is willing to do their assigned work at a serviceable pace. Some follow-up reminders were required to make sure we meet deadlines as a group but that is reasonably expected for any type of group work. I think the good results of assignments is a valid metric and reflects our smooth collaboration as a group. Some areas that can be improved were mostly concerned with individual member’s talent as some of us were taking this course as an elective and heavily struggled with the HTML coding portion of this assignment. An area that can be improved would be to increase the help we provide to members that were having a literature blunder and can't write the required portion on reports. It is surprising to me that group members were mostly first-year students but they were also adept at working on web designs. One thing I’ve learned about groups is that they function better if everyone actively replies, even though they cannot provide a definitive answer, the constant communication furthers along the process of coming up with a final solution.</p>
