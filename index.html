        <p> I'm a Vietnamese student at RMIT University getting a bachelor's degree in information technology. When I have the time, I hope to learn Korean and Japanese in addition to English and Vietnamese. Outside of school, I enjoy playing video games heavily on both PCs and mobile devices, and I have a wide range of musical tastes. My asthma made me hesitant at first, but now that I have a wonderful pet cat named Meo, I couldn't be happier. Be the coordinator for new system setups pertaining to company strategy topics. Be in charge of analysis on portfolio performance management, visualizing business patterns, and offering strategic actions. The position of data analyst is one in which I am really interested. My interest in data analysis stems from another subject that I was introduced to by my professor. Despite the fact that the work itself is very demanding and requires much experience, it pays well.</p>
