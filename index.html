        <p> I'm a Vietnamese student at RMIT University getting a bachelor's degree in information technology. When I have the time, I hope to learn Korean and Japanese in addition to English and Vietnamese. Outside of school, I enjoy playing video games heavily on both PCs and mobile devices, and I have a wide range of musical tastes. My asthma made me hesitant at first, but now that I have a wonderful pet cat named Meo, I couldn't be happier. Be the coordinator for new system setups pertaining to company strategy topics. Be in charge of analysis on portfolio performance management, visualizing business patterns, and offering strategic actions. The position of data analyst is one in which I am really interested. My interest in data analysis stems from another subject that I was introduced to by my professor. Despite the fact that the work itself is very demanding and requires much experience, it pays well.

        <p>I'm a third-year RMIT Vietnam student named Nguyen Duc Anh. I take great satisfaction in examining the complexities of data and gaining insightful knowledge as a student who has a penchant for reading data tables. I'm on my way to get a bachelor's in software engineering. I enjoy playing MMORPGS (Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games) with a dynamic market structure in addition to my academic endeavors. As I examine market trends and player interactions, I can ignite my curiosity on data engineering by participating in these virtual economies. I'm excited to work with other gamers, data engineers, and data specialists to share knowledge and experiences in these fascinating fields.

        <p>My major is currently Information Technology, and my minor is Data Analytics. To be honest, I was born in 2003 and should have finished my second year of college by now. However, I initially selected to study Software Engineering, but after a year of study, I realized it was not for me, so I changed my major to Data Analytics. Regarding my high school career, I maintained a high GPA and engaged in school activities. Along with learning, I enjoy sports and have a particular fondness for football. I play football with my friends about 2-3 times every week. I enjoy this sport because it not only helps me improve my physical health but also allows me to make me closer to my friends. Reading novels is another of my interests. I've read some great books, like Kane and Abel, The Count of Monte Cristo, and Sherlock Holmes.

        <p>My major is artificial intelligence, and I am a first-year IT student. I am only in the first semester of the program, but I already adore IT. I'm now enrolled in database, programming, and introduction to IT classes. I learn about many technologies in these classes and get practical programming experience. I've so far found that I've most loved the programming course, and I'm considering a career in software engineering. A full-stack developer position would be excellent for me because it involves both frontend and backend work. I'll be able to produce incredible software every day by writing code. As teamwork is a crucial programming skill, I'll do my best to learn it and contribute to a team project.

        <p><span class="bold-text">Personality:</span> Logistician (ISTP)</p>
        <p>I attend RMIT Vietnam as a Vietnamese fourth-year robotics student. During my previous semesters at RMIT, I took a number of additional courses that included IT-related content as part of my core program and as electives. My current IT interests are in network security and the overall network infrastructure. My ideal position, if I were to pursue an IT-related career path, would be a software consultant. I will work closely with development teams on their projects as part of said role to provide guidance on each project's deliverables and solutions. I would be able to contribute to projects in this role while still being largely independent from any development teams, which would help me organize my work better.
