        <p>Testing is a crucial part of project development, and it should be performed continuously throughout the project’s life cycle to ensure that it meets its objectives and aligns with user expectations. There’s a few testing components that we need to perform:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Component testing: Before assembly all components together, individual parts of the system should be tested. We need to ensure that the Raspberry Pi can communicate with the soil moisture sensor, the water pump can be controlled effectively, and the software can collect and interpret data accurately. </li>
            <li>Functional testing: This test focuses on the core functionality of the system, which is automating plant watering based on soil moisture levels. Ensure that the system accurately measures soil moisture, activates the water pump as needed, and delivers an appropriate amount of water to the plants. 
            </li>
            <li>Long-term testing: This test will assess the system’s durability and reliability over time. It monitors how the system performs in different weather conditions and under extended use.</li>
            <li>User testing: We aim to recruit a group of test users who have varying levels of gardening experience. Users should provide feedback on the system’s performance, accuracy in watering plants, and any additional features they find valuable. 
                Here’s a plan for user testing:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Find test users: there are various places, and locations we can look for potential test users. These include local gardening clubs, online gardening forums, friends and family, etc. People that have experience in gardening can be excellent test users as they can provide helpful feedback for the project.
                </li>
                <li>Number of test users: Our plan will start with a small group of test users (around 5-10 users) for the initial phase, and gradually increase to a larger sample size if necessary. The key is to gather enough feedback to identify common issues and improvements.
                </li>
                <li>Background requirements: We will look for people who have gardening experience, tech proficiency with a diverse environment. This will ensure that the user will have enough insight in gardening, as well as familiarity with using phone apps. Diverse backgrounds can help provide a wider range of opinions and feedback on our project. 
                </li>
            </ul>
            <li>Performance testing: This test will check the system’s performance under various scenarios, including high-demand situations. Check how it handles multiple plant zones, data storage, and simultaneous user interactions.</li>
            <li>Edge case testing: Identify potential edge cases, such as extreme weather conditions, sensor failures, or unusual user interactions, and test how the system handles these situations. </li>
        </ol>
        <p>The project can be considered successful when it meets all of the following requirements: </p>
        <ol>
            <li>The system maintains plant health by accurately monitoring and regulating soil moisture level. </li>
            <li>User feedback indicates high user satisfaction with the system’s functionality and usability.</li>
            <li>The system demonstrates reliability and durability during long-term testing, operating effectively in various environmental conditions. </li>
            <li>It can operate without significant issues, including sensor malfunctions, water pump failures, or software glitches. </li>
        </ol>
