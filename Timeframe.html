        <p>From week 1-2, we are going to plan and research about our project meticulously. We will divide our tasks in these 2 two weeks into small steps. Initially, we aspire to define our project objectives. Then, we will identify certain specific requirements such as soil type, tree type, temperature and water quanlity. After determining the goals and requirements, we aim to research several appropriate sensors such as temperature sensor, soil moisture and humidity sensor. The next step is to create a detailed plan to build the project and calculate a budget for purchasing components and materials. Finally, we have to plan a weekly schedule for communication between team members.</p>
        <p>From week 3-4, we intend to finish component procurement and set up these items. In week 3, we are going to order essential items such as Raspberry PI, sensors, power supply, tubing and so on. After purchasing these components, we will verify whether they meet our demands as well as check if these components are compatible with others. In week 4, we plan to spend time on researching and setting up Raspberry Pi with a suitable operating system. Finally, we will construct network settings and establish SSH or VNC remote access for the project.</p>
        <p>From week 5-6, we prepare for assembling sensors and confront with data. Firstly, we will install essential libraries for sensors. Then, we will utilize Python to write code to read data from sensors. After this step, we can combine sensor data with the Raspberry Pi and apply data logging to record sensor readings. Finally, we will create a local database to store this data.</p>
        <p>From week 7-8, our objective is to make a watering system prototype. First of all, we will choose an appropriate water pump so as to design a prototype watering system. From prepared sensor readings, we will write code to control and supervise our watering system prototype. In week 8, our team will spend on verifying and testing our prototype with a small-scale setup. After testing, we will modify watering parameters based on sensor data.</p>
        <p>From week 9-10, we will build a power supply system which provides energy for our watering system. In week 9, our ambition is to build a solar power system to generate energy by acquiring heat from the sunsight. This step will consume a range of time because we want to guarantee that our system can work for a long-term period. After building the power supply system, we will observe and verify our system to ensure our system can work efficiently. Furthermore, our team also plans to build a backup energy supply such as batteries in case our main power generator encounters issues.</p>
        <p>From week 11-12, we will cope with building user interface and data visualization. In the first week, our team will create a friendly user interface to help our customers can control and interact with the system easily. We also aim to provide users with data monitoring so that users can easily see fluctuations in soil moisture, humidity and temperature. To do this, we need to develop code and utilize visualization tools to display sensor data graphically in a clear way. After building the user interface, in week 12, we intend to create alerting systems which will send notifications via email and SMS for the clients.</p>
        <p>From week 13-14, we aim to spend these 2 weeks for verifying and final testing. Our team will conduct certain testing for all functions included in our project such as power system, user interface and so on. We will also troubleshoot components and codes to ensure that there are not any bugs or issues. We are inclined to test our system in a variety of different conditions to guarantee that our product runs smoothly, even in hazardous conditions.</p>
        <p>From week 15-16, this is 2 final weeks and we are going to write a report as well as prepare for a demonstration of our system. Firstly, we will divide each section for each member to write and set a deadline for this. After finishing the report, we will check it together and then we will gather to make slides for the presentation. In the last days of the project, we plan to organize a day to practice for the presentation.</p>
